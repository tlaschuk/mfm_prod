        "question" : "How do I install and use these missions?",

       // "question" : "How do I install the documentation packages?",
      //  "answer"   : "When you download the documentation package you will get a .miz file. Rename the .miz extension to .exe and run that file. Some browsers may change the .miz to .man or some other extension. If you rename the extension to .exe that should allow you to run the program. Once run it will prompt you for the mission key and then install the file into the default document directory for the game or you can change it if you have installed your game to another directory. To use the documentation select it from the Start Menu, All Programs, MapleFlagMissions, DCS World folder. Please consult our File installation guide PDF available <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GJ-2wKWbw_b3JfcGdKREZNRkE/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."

       // {
      //  "question" : "I don't have a Mission Key. What do I do?",
      //  "answer"   : "For the pay to play missions you need a Mission Key to install the Mission files. To get a Mission Key you have to install a License program first which creates a System Unique Id (SUID). You send us the SUID and we generate the Mission Key and send it back to you. Please consult our License File installation guide PDF available <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GJ-2wKWbw_ZUxlNUVpWjdKcHc/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."

       // {
      //  "question" : "My Mission Key does not work. What do I do?",
      //  "answer"   : "Check for leading or trailing spaces when you enter the mission key. If it still fails it could be because the SUID Key has changed due to other changes on your system. You can check if your SUID Key is still valid by downloading the SUID Key Check program <a href=\"http://www3.sympatico.ca/tlaschuk/mapleflagmissions/SUID_CHECKER.V1.0.exe\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
      //  },
        {
        "question" : "My SUID has changed, can I get new Mission Keys to match?",
        "answer"   : "Yes until one year after the MapleFlagMissions campaign is available from the ED store. For the A-10C BFT Campaign that is until March 20th, 2017.  After that we will only support the DCS E-store versions. Email us the new SUID and we will generate new Mission Keys for you. Requests are monitored and if signs of abuse are detected we reserve the right to disallow future Mission Key generation."
        },
        {
        "question" : "How do I un-install these missions?",
        "answer"   : "Under the Start menu in the folder called MapleFlagMissions you will find an Uninstall program. Just run it for the mission you want to un-install."
        },
        {
        "question" : "What is the difference between free and \"Pay to Play\" missions?",
        "answer"   : "The free missions have no installer so you can put them into the missions folder as they are downloaded and you can play them for free. The \"Pay to Play\" missions are painstakingly researched for the ultimate in realism and immersion. They have enhanced functionality like more realistic maps and diagrams, accurate radio calls, more ground and air traffic, and busier, more realistic airport settings. They strive for the highest level of realism and immersive game play. These missions are installed using the DCS Module Manager in-game."
        },
        {
            "question" : "How do I install and play the \"Play to Pay\" missions?",
            "answer": "These missions are installed using the DCS Module Manager in-game."
        },
        {
        "question": "Can I transfer my purchase if or when your campaigns end up on the ED Store?",
        "answer": "Unfortuantely no. You would have to decide to purchase the campaign again if you wanted to use the DCS Module Manager.  We will support our mission key distribution method until March 20th, 2017.  After that we hope all customers will use the DCS Module Manager for updates."
        },
       // {
      //  "question" : "Why such a complicated key scheme?",
       // "answer"   : "This is a requirement from TFC/ED for paid content. Free content is not wrapped in an installer and can simply be downloaded and installed as is."
      //  },
       // {
      //  "question" : "Do I have to buy a new mission key for updates or patches to missions I have already paid for?",
     //   "answer"   : "No. Since you paid for the mission you will be registered in our customer database and all future updates and patches will be free. In most cases your existing Mission Key will work for the update or patch. Where a new Mission Key is required it will be emailed to you."
     //   },
        {
        "question" : "What about viruses? Can my computer get infected by installing your missions?",
        "answer"   : "No. We use a current, popular Anti-Virus program to scan all files before uploading. We do all the mission creation in house so there is no risk of a 3rd party introducing unwanted content."
        },
        {
        "question" : "What operating systems are your missions written for?",
        "answer"   : "Currently it is Windows based: XP, Vista, Windows7, Windows8 and Windows10. We are highly dependent on the platform chosen by the game developer."
        },
        {
        "question" : "Why the name Maple Flag Missions?",
        "answer"   : "We are Canadian and the Maple Leaf is a symbol of Canada's flag. Maple Flag to represent the Maple Flag exercises held by the RCAF at Cold Lake, Alberta (similar to the USAF's Red Flag exercises). Missions as we specialize in mission design."
