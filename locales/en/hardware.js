        "hotas"   : "To get the most enjoyment from your simulator we recommend at least a joystick to control the pitch and roll of the aircraft: flying is much easier and more realistic with one. Vehicle control is equally improved. A throttle and rudder pedals will also make your flying more enjoyable and immersive. At Maple Flag Missions we use the <strong>Thrustmaster's Warthog HOTAS</strong> and <strong>Saitek Rudder Pedals.</strong>",
        "trackir" : "<strong>TrackIR</strong> is a controller that can follow your head movement and change the direction you are viewing while in game. This is a must for dogfighting or tracking a target while flying and provides a very immersive experience. Once you try it you will never want to play without it again.",
        "monitor" : "Targets are much easier to see and cockpits are larger, making it feel like you are actually in the pit. With the mouse, clickable cockpits, and a fancy IR glove you can select the switches on screen further adding to the immersion. We use a <strong>47\" LG LK520</strong> at Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080)."
